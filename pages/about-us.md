#### **About People's Association**

The People’s Association (PA) was established on 1 July 1960 as a statutory board to promote racial harmony and social cohesion in Singapore. Our mission is to build and bridge communities in achieving one people, one Singapore. 

PA offers a broad spectrum of programmes to cater to Singaporeans from all walks of life – connecting people to people, and people to government. We do this through our network of 1,800 grassroots organisations (GROs), over 100 Community Clubs, five Community Development Councils, National Community Leadership Institute and Water-Venture.
