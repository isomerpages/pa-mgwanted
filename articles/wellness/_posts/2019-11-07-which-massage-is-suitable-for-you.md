If you are new to massage, it might be a little confusing to decide on the different kinds out there. From Balinese to Swedish, there are so many to choose from, and they all have different benefits and healing techniques. Don't worry, we have created a list of massages and why you should try them to aid you in finding the suitable massage! 

### BEGINNER – RHYTHMIC MASSAGE
This massage balances the body with warm, nurturing strokes that promote healing. Focused on warmth, breathing and rhythm, the therapist uses suction to target tense muscle tissue. Join us for our [Rhythmic Massage](../../course-directory/health-and-wellness/#rhythmic-massage) course to learn how to activate your body’s forces to promote physical and mental wellbeing. 

**Try it if:** You feel a sense of imbalance and want a healing, invigorating massage.

### INTERMEDIATE – HOT STONE MASSAGE
Hot stone massage is characterised by the therapist using flat, heated stones in addition to their hands to relieve tension and tough knots. Sometimes cold stones are also used to soothe the skin after. 

**Try it if:** You suffer moderate tension with stubborn trouble spots and find therapeutic heat relaxing.

### ADVANCED – DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE
As the name suggests, this type of massage uses more intense kneading techniques to relieve tension in the deeper layers of muscle tissue. The therapist uses slow strokes and strong pressure to dissolve chronic pain.

**Try it if:** You suffer from chronic muscle tension or pain and prefer more pressure during your massage.
