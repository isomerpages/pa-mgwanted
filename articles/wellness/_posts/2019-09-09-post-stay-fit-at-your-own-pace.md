### FULL SPEED AHEAD
A form of variable-intensity interval training (VIIT), Mashup&reg; is a convenient way to workout without compromising on intensity! The 1-hour class features low-intensity exercises such as dynamic stretching which help improve joint mobility, while medium-intensity segments focus on agility and endurance. High-intensity intervals then allow your body's fat-burning potential to naturally increase, giving you a well-rounded full-body workout.
