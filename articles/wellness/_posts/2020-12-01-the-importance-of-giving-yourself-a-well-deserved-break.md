With our $100 SingaporeRediscovers vouchers to look forward to utilising from December onwards, it’s about time we give ourselves a few days away from the stresses of our daily routine. Kill two birds with one stone by focusing on self-care and having some fun through staycations and leisure activities like visiting museums and theme parks. Read on to find out more about the benefits of taking some time off.

### A MUCH-NEEDED BREAK
In light of our many challenges this year, time away from daily life is a welcomed break. Improve your mental health and well-being by spending a few days by yourself or with your loved ones.

### UNWIND AND EXPLORE 
Fully utilise your short break to replenish your energy – both physically and mentally. We may sometimes forget how tiring our schedules can be and push our bodies to the point of burning out. Hit reset through some relaxing activities and rediscover everything Singapore has to offer.

### SELF-REFLECTION
As we reach the end of 2020, reflect on what you have achieved and what you want to accomplish moving forward. Relieve yourself of built-up stress and give yourself a pat on the back as you focus on how you have overcome this difficult year. Take a quiet moment to think about the steps you can take to improve for the future.
