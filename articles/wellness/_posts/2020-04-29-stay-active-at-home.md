With most of us working from home and going outside being reserved for necessities, staying healthy can be a challenge. And while you can still go out to exercise, social distancing means that group workouts are a no-no. So, maintain your health during the circuit breaker guilt-free with these simple tips and stay fit indoors!

### SIT LESS
Try to interrupt your sitting time every half an hour by standing or walking around the house. It may not seem like much, but just making sure you move around more is a great way to burn calories and keep your body active.

### MAKE CHORES FUN
Turn housework into mini games so you have a fun way to exercise. Vacuum the room in 2 minutes or try to fold laundry with only one hand at a time. You could also play some music and dance while you mop or sweep to double down on the workout.

### GO ONLINE
Follow an online exercise class like our Cardio Pilates Workout so you have a guided routine to do at home. Most online classes require little to no equipment, and you can decide what kind of exercise you prefer as well as which level of intensity is right for you.
