Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) treatments have been used for thousands of years and many, such as acupuncture and Gua Sha, are still in use today. Controlling the flow of the body's vital energy, or chi, these healing techniques focuses on improving bodily functions such as digestion, breathing and blood circulation.

Gua Sha involves scraping the skin with a smooth-edged massage tool in order to circulate the chi in your body. From improving skin health to relieving muscle tension, the natural remedy is known to be a powerful form of massage therapy.  Learn more about the benefits of this healing treatment and discover why it should be the latest addition to your self-care routine.

### PROMOTES BLOOD CIRCULATION
The therapy increases blood flow and breaks up stagnant energy in your body. It stimulates the circulation of soft tissue to improve overall health and increases the hydration of your skin.

### RELIEVES PAIN
Gua Sha is known to reduce inflammation. It can improve chronic pain and relieve muscle tension, such as migraines and stiff neck.

### USAGE AND SIDE EFFECTS
Gua Sha is safe as a natural healing remedy but if you have had surgery in the last six weeks, are taking blood thinners or have clotting disorders, do not practise this technique.

If any bleeding occurs, there is also a risk of transferring blood-borne illnesses, so do ensure your technician has properly disinfected all tools.

While the method is not painful, it may change the appearance of your skin â€“ small blood vessels in the skin may burst due to the rubbing and scraping with the massage tool. Some may also experience temporary indentation of their skin after Gua Sha treatment. Bruising usually disappears within a few days.
