It's important to take care of yourself, especially when you're a caregiver. Not only will it give your mind and body a much-needed break, but it will also improve your ability to care for others. Give yourself permission to look after yourself too and take a look at these quick self-care tips for caregivers. 

### HAVE A BALANCED DIET
Quick meals may be convenient but a nutritious diet maintains your health and energy while helping you stay full for longer. Skip the fast food and opt for low-calorie, high-protein foods like salmon or tofu that also provide you with your daily calcium intake.

### GET ENOUGH SLEEP
A good sleep routine of 7-9 hours a day ensures you don't burn out. If you have to wake up at night to care for your loved one, take short naps during the day to give your body time to recuperate.

### TREAT YOURSELF
Don't feel guilty about having a massage or special dinner out once in a while. This helps you feel rewarded and relieves any stress you may be feeling. Taking breaks and engaging in simple activities you enjoy during the day, such as reading a book or watching a movie, will improve your mental wellbeing and allow you to care for your loved ones more effectively.
