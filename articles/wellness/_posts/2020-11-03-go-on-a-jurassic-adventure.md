Changi Airport's latest dinosaur exhibit, Jurassic Mile, promises a fun day out while getting in a good work out. The connector path to East Coast Park features life-sized dinosaurs alongside information panels that educate visitors about the Jurassic Period. Here's everything you need to know about how to explore this outdoor exhibit with a ferocious twist. 

### GETTING THERE
Alight at Changi Airport Terminal 4, Car Park 4A and follow the on-ground signage for direct access to Jurassic Mile. You can also access Jurassic Mile from East Coast Park via Changi Coastal Park Connector.

### ON FOOT
Walk or jog pass over 20 life-like dinosaurs from 9 different species! The 3.5km path from East Coast Park will take about half an hour to jog through, depending on pace.

### CYCLING
Rent bicycles from East Coast Park or Changi Airport for a low-impact workout that's easier on your joints. You can drop off your bikes at rental stores at either end once you're done. While cycling the connector will only take about 15-20 minutes, you can also cycle all the way to Marina Bay through connected cycling paths for a better workout, if you are game for it.

Did you know that you could probably outrun a T-Rex? Scientists have discovered that despite its reputation, the giant carnivore was only capable of a light jog. So get your running shoes on and whizz past your favourite dinosaurs next weekend for a fun day out with your loved ones.
