Don't worry, we have created a list of massages and why you should try them to aid you in finding the suitable massage! 

### BEGINNER – RHYTHMIC MASSAGE
This massage balances the body with warm, nurturing strokes that promote healing. Focused on warmth, breathing and rhythm, the therapist uses suction to target tense muscle tissue.

### INTERMEDIATE – HOT STONE MASSAGE

**Try it if:** You suffer moderate tension with stubborn trouble spots and find therapeutic heat relaxing.

### ADVANCED – DEEP TISSUE MASSAGE
As the name suggests, this type of massage uses more intense kneading techniques to relieve tension in the deeper layers of muscle tissue. The therapist uses slow strokes and strong pressure to dissolve chronic pain.

**Try it if:** You suffer from chronic muscle tension or pain and prefer more pressure during your massage.
