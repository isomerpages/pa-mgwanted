Whether you want to get in shape or reduce your risk of chronic disease, regular exercise is essential to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Although effective, workouts like jogging and skipping rope can strain your muscles and cause injury in the long term, especially if you suffer from conditions like arthritis. Try these low-impact activities that allow you to stay fit while being gentle on your joints!

### SWIMMING
Exercising in water allows you to work out in a buoyant environment. Since water has much higher resistance than air, moving through it also gives you the added benefit of having natural weights on your body. This means you can burn just as many calories without any pressure on your joints. And if swimming laps arenâ€™t your thing, try water aerobics as a fun activity you can do with friends!

### TAI CHI
Tai chi is a martial art that uses slow, controlled movements. Known to improve balance and stamina, the discipline gives you a full body workout while remaining gentle on your muscles and joints. Often described as meditation in motion, tai chi also teaches mindfulness to strengthen your mind along with your body.

### YOGA
Known to reduce stress and promote both physical and mental health, yoga focuses on a variety of postures and breathing exercises that help to develop your strength and flexibility. Integrating the whole body, it works out different muscle groups to stimulate blood flow and decrease tension.
