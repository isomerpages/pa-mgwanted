From giving your body the right nutrients to reducing your risk of chronic illnesses, a healthy diet provides a multitude of benefits. Discover some of the simple ways you can improve your eating habits and start your journey towards a healthier you!

### SLOW DOWN
Chew your food slowly and savour every bite. Not only will this enhance the flavour, but it’ll also give your body enough time to digest it. It takes your brain about 20 minutes to receive signals that you are full, so eating slowly can actually help you manage your meals more effectively and cut down on extra calories.

### SHOP WITH A GROCERY LIST
Prepare your shopping list ahead of time when you’re buying groceries. Not knowing exactly what you need could lead to impulse buying. By writing everything down and sticking to your list, you’ll buy healthier items and save some money at the same time!

### CHANGE THE WAY YOU COOK
The way you prepare your food can greatly alter its effects on your health. Instead of frying meat and fish, bake them in the oven to cut down on your intake of fats and calories. Other healthier cooking methods include pressure cooking and poaching. You can still enjoy the occasional grill or deep-fry but try to save that for the weekends or special events to keep your daily meals healthier.
