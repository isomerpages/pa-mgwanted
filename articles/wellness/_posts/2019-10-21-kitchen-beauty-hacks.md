### BLACK PEPPER FOR BLEMISHES
Use this black pepper body scrub once a week to get rid of acne! And if you are looking for a face scrub, use only finely ground pepper for gentler exfoliation.

#### You Will Need:
- 1 cup of coconut oil
- ¼ cup of salt
- 2 tablespoons of coarsely ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons of finely ground black pepper
- 5 drops of peppermint essential oil (optional)

#### Method:
1. Place the coconut oil in the microwave and heat for about 30 seconds, or until fully melted.
2. Add the essential oil and stir.
3. Add salt and black pepper and mix well.  
4. Wait for the scrub to cool down. Then, apply it to your body and rub in circular motions to remove dead skin cells. 
5. Wash off with lukewarm water.

#### Why It Works:
Black pepper is a great organic exfoliator. It helps to clear acne and blackheads by scrubbing away excess oil and bacteria!
