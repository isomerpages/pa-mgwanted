The next time you are looking to delight guests with your baked creations for tea time, look no further than a cup of tea. Tea adds a rich and fragrant dimension to baked goods like cakes and cookies, elevating flavours beyond the ordinary and expected.

Infusing tea into your sweet treats is as easy as making a cup of tea for yourself. Here are three common ways you can add a dash of aromatic flavour to your cakes and cookies that’s sure to please your guests:

### TEA WITH WATER

The addition of tea is a great way to add flavour to the regular sugar-and-water glaze. Just steep some tea in water and mix it with sugar over heat. For stronger flavour, try adding extra tea leaves into the mix.

### TEA WITH MILK

Warm some milk (it’s fine to use dairy or non-dairy milk) over the stove. Add a few teaspoons of tea leaves and let the mixture steep without boiling for 15 minutes. Strain the mixture before baking and you’ll have yourself a yummy yet healthy tea-infused pudding.

### TEA WITH BUTTER

Make tea-rrific cookies by melting some butter with loose-leaf tea. Let the tea mix with the butter for 15 minutes without browning the butter. Strain it while the butter is still melted.
