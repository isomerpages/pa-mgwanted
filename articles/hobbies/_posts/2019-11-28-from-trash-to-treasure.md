Does your house have things you no longer use? Give new life to your old items by upcycling them! There are so many different ways you can repurpose these unexpected treasures. Use the list below as inspiration and start your upcycling journey today.

### GLASSES CASE STORAGE
Your spectacles case is the perfect multi-purpose storage tool! Reuse this handy container for cable storage when you travel, or fill it with a pincushion, thread and some sewing needles for a portable sewing kit.

### NECKLACE CAMERA STRAP 
Turn an old necklace into a one-of-a-kind camera strap. Combine it with a statement brooch for vintage flair and add a personal touch by creating unique combinations to complement your style.
