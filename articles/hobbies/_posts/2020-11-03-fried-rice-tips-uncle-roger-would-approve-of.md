Egg fried rice is a staple in Singaporean cuisine but as Uncle Roger reminds us, other cultures around the world don't always get it right. Learn how you can make this hawker favourite easily at home with these tips! Try the fried rice recipe below for a healthier version of this simple classic.

### RICE

As we all know, it's one part rice, two parts water. Add a pinch of salt to your boiling water if you're cooking on the stove and leave your rice to steam for 15 minutes. Or better yet, use a rice cooker! Leave it to cool in the fridge overnight for better texture for your fried rice.

### EGGS

Crack your eggs into a bowl and beat them together with a teaspoon of sesame oil for added flavour. Once you've tossed in your rice and any other vegetables like peas or carrots, pour in your eggs and stir until they're cooked through.

### SPRING ONION

Chop your spring onion finely and add to your stir-fry along with some soy sauce for added aroma. You can also use it as garnish at the end for extra crunch.

### GET CREATIVE

Put a spin on your fried rice by adding a personal touch. Throw in some cheese or teriyaki sauce for a unique blend of flavours. You can also experiment with various chilli pastes to get your own spicy kick by using a tablespoon of mala paste or sambal chilli paste.
