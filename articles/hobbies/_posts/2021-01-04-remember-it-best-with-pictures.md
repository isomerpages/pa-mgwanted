As they say, seeing is believing. 

Like the widely circulated photo of a crocodile that was spotted in the middle of a walking trail at the Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve. While this encounter can be recounted with words, only a picture can convey the extraordinariness of the moment fully and immediately. 

A great way to preserve once-in-a-lifetime memories is by creating a scrapbook. The very actions of the craft itself – sorting, cutting, assembling, pasting – give you the opportunity to revisit your favourite moments. The result is a tangible piece of work that lets you and your loved ones take a trip down memory lane together, whenever the mood strikes. 

Are you feeling inspired already? Here are some useful tips to help you get started on your scrapbook. 

### CHOOSE A THEME

Do you like it to be fun, thoughtful, or whimsical? Deciding on a theme for your scrapbook is an important step as it will determine its design. Guided by a clear direction, your work will feel whole and consistent from the first page to the last.

### DECIDE ON THE RIGHT ORDER 

How do you want your scrapbook to flow? With so many elements coming into play, organisation is key. Before your start cutting and pasting, consider how you want to display your photos. You can choose to sort them by date, setting or special occasion.

### GET CREATIVE

A scrapbook is more than just a photo album. Try experimenting with different decorative elements like textured papers, tapes, markers and paint. Including mementoes like postcards, notes and sketches can also breathe life into a memory and make your work extra personal to your heart.
