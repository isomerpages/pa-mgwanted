### BRINJALS
**Why they’re great:** Brinjals are a great source of fibre and B-6 vitamins. They’re also packed full of antioxidants that improve cholesterol levels and heart health. 

**How to grow:** Brinjals thrive in direct sunlight and moist soil so plant a few seeds in a clay pot and water them daily for the best results!

### CHERRY TOMATOES 
**Why they’re great:** This potassium-rich fruit lowers blood pressure and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. It is also rich in vitamin C that boosts immunity and collagen production.

**How to grow:** Get a wire cage or find a spot close to a railing that can support the tomato vines as they grow. Water daily and feed your seedlings with organic fertiliser once a week.

### KANGKONG
**Why they’re great:** Kangkong is a water-rich vegetable that will keep you hydrated in our tropical climate. This low calorie green is also filled with valuable nutrients like fibre, calcium and iron. 

**How to grow:** Cut several 30 to 40cm long cuttings of kangkong stems and plant them in direct sunlight. Be sure to keep the soil wet at all times as they thrive in muddy environments. You can even plant them at the edge of a pond or body of water.
