Whether it’s for a special occasion or just to add a little colour to your home, flowers offer us a sense of joy and warmth. But what happens when those petals start to wilt? Learn how you can give your beautiful bouquet a second life with these eco-friendly tips.

### MAKE POTPOURRI
Use potpourri as a natural air freshener for your home. To make some, dry your flowers by hanging them upside down in a cool, dry area. You can then add some scent to the petals by spraying them with an essential oil like lavender or bergamot. Place your blooms in a loosely woven sachet and add some dried mint or cloves to make it double as a moth deterrent!

### COMPOST IT
It may not be the prettiest way to reuse old flowers, but turning your bouquets into mulch or compost is a great way to reduce waste. It can be used as organic fertiliser for your garden, nourishing the soil so new flowers can grow.

### GET CRAFTY
There are so many different craft projects that you can incorporate dried or pressed flowers into. Add dried petals to wax to make personalised floral candles and use organic flowers for a bath salt mixture or hand-milled soap. You can also press your wilting blooms into decorative pieces like photo frames and laminated bookmarks.
