Music has always played an important role in human history. Whether it’s Chinese Opera or The Rolling Stones, our connection to music and the way it makes us feel is undeniable. But did you know that learning how to play an instrument has a profound effect not just on our mind but on our bodies as well?

### ENHANCES BRAIN FUNCTION
Playing an instrument can actually alter your brain structure and improve the way it functions. Studies have shown that musical training improves long-term memory, spatial reasoning and even literacy skills.

### RELIEVES STRESS
Stress starts in the brain and begins a chain reaction that turns on the stress response in all of our cells. Playing music, on the other hand, alleviates anxiety by creating an opposite reaction that turns these genes off again. It also lowers your heart rate, calming both your mind and body.

### IMPROVES PHYSICAL HEALTH
Whether it’s the drums, guitar or piano, learning how to play an instrument offers many benefits to your physical health and wellbeing. Over time, your posture will improve because you have to sit upright to produce the best sound. It also lowers your blood pressure and even increases blood flow to the brain, making you feel energised after a session.
