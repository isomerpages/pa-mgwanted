So, when the craving strikes or if it’s not convenient to head out to a dim sum restaurant, why not make your own at home with these simple recipes of perennial dim sum favourites?

Mix everything together, except the bamboo shoots. Whip in one direction for a few minutes until the mixture starts to look sticky. Add bamboo shoots next and mix everything together. Cover and refrigerate while preparing the dough.

**For the dough:**
Mix wheat starch and corn starch in a mixing bowl. Add boiling water slowly while stirring rapidly. Now add the lard and continue stirring.

Cover the dough pieces with a damp paper towel.

**Assembling and cooking the dumplings:**
1. Turn on the stove to pre-boil the water in the steamer. Take one piece of dough and roll it into a 3" diameter circle. Add a spoonful of filling and fold the dumpling. Continue assembling until all the dumplings are made.
2.	When the water in the steamer is boiled, steam the dumplings for 6 minutes using high heat and serve hot. Make sure they each have an inch and a half to expand during the cooking process.
