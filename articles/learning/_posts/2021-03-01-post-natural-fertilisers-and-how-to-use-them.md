Plants need nutrient-rich soil to grow properly. But synthetic fertilisers can do more harm than good to both your leafy friends and you. Don’t go to the store to buy fertiliser, you can make your own with ingredients in your home! Learn about different natural fertilisers below and how you can use them to help your plants thrive.

### BANANA PEELS
Flowering plants love potassium, and bananas are packed with it! 

Take one or two banana peels and place them at the base of your pot before planting or bury them under mulch so they can compost naturally. This method will give you more flowers and fuller blooms.

### COFFEE GROUNDS
Don’t let your coffee grounds go to waste! Their high nitrogen content makes them great for your plants. 

Simply sprinkle them on top of the soil, before watering, to add nutrients. You can also use it as a soil drench by mixing ¼ cup of coffee grounds with about a litre of water. Let the mixture sit for 2 days before pouring around your plants. For acid-loving plants like tomatoes and azaleas, mix dry coffee grounds directly into the soil to give your plants a pH boost.

### EGGSHELLS
The next time you think about throwing those eggshells away, think again. 

Full of calcium, eggshells are an ideal fertiliser. Wash and crush them before adding pieces into the soil near your plants. Preventing blossom end rot, this simple fix will help fruits like tomatoes and peppers grow healthily.

### SEAWEED
Turns out we aren’t the only ones who love seaweed – our plants do too!

Both fresh and dried seaweed serve as a food source for healthy soil microbes, making them excellent for plants. Just chop them up and add water at a 2:3 ratio. Let this sit for 2 weeks, loosely covered, and use it to drench the soil and leaves when ready.

### WEEDS
We all know that weeds are bad for our garden, but these pesky plants also have their benefits.

Weeds are full of nutrients that can actually help our plants. As long they haven’t flowered, leave pulled weeds in the sun to convert them to mulch. Once they’re completely dried out, chop them up and add them to the top of your soil to improve plant growth.

### PET FOOD
Not all pet food is organic, but even the cheaper varieties are rich in protein and micro-nutrients.

Mix dry pet food with soil before watering and let the food decay naturally to enrich your plants. Be sure your chosen pet food isn’t high in sodium for best results!
