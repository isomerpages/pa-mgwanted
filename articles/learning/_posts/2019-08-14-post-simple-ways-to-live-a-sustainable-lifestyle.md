Living sustainably doesn’t mean you have to give up comfort or convenience. Going green is all about being aware of depleting resources and reducing unnecessary waste where possible. With just a little bit of effort, you can significantly lessen the impact of your consumption habits on Mother Earth! Take a look at these simple tips to help you start your sustainable journey.

### DUMP DISPOSABLES
In the past, you wouldn’t have dreamed of single-use bottles or cups. But these days, plastic is everywhere. It’s easier than ever to use an object once and just throw it away after. Start buying reusable products instead and ditch plastic in favour of glass! Glass containers are so much better for our planet and can be repurposed in so many different ways. Learn how to Upcycle Your Bottle into decorative pieces and cut down on plastic waste!
