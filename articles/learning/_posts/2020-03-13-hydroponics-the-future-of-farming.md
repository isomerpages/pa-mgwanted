Hydroponic farming could be the future of industrial farming as we know it.  With Singapore being scarce in land area, hydroponic farms are an innovative way we can produce fresh homegrown greens without sacrificing valuable space for development. Read on to learn more about this revolutionary method of farming and how it works.

### WHAT IS HYDROPONICS?
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants without soil. Instead, the roots are placed in a nutrient-rich water solution to nourish the plants as they develop.

### HOW DOES IT WORK?
There are many different ways to grow plants hydroponically. One popular method is the nutrient-film technique, where nutrients are pumped across the roots with the help of a pump. Another method uses granite or sand, which act as a sterile substitute for soil, to support the roots.

### WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?
Hydroponic farming uses 1/5 of the water used in traditional farming. Looking towards the future as water becomes less accessible, this method would result in greater yield with fewer resources required. 

Hydroponic plants also grow faster and since they are grown indoors, you can harvest them year-round. Many pests are also carried through soil, so plants would have fewer problems of disease.
