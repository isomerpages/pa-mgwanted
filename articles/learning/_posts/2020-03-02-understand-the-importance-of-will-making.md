Preparing a will is vital to ensure everything goes smoothly when you pass on your estate. Having a clear and thorough will allows those you care for to respect your wishes and make sense of their situation more easily. So, take charge of your legacy with these simple tips and make sure your loved ones have nothing to worry about.

### BE ACCURATE
It’s important to be clear in the wording of your will so it can be carried out easily. Make sure that all the information is correct and that none of your requests contradict themselves. This gives your beneficiaries concise instructions on your wishes without leaving any room for ambiguity.

### STAY UP TO DATE
Keeping your will up to date is essential. Changes in your lifestyle mean that you will probably want to amend your wishes as you get older. Ensure you update your will whenever there is a shift in your personal relationships so it reflects your true intent at the time of your passing.

### EXPLAIN YOUR CHOICES
Discussing your decisions with your family beforehand is the easiest way to avoid disagreements. However, if this is not possible, writing a declaration to accompany your will can help to explain to your loved ones why you’ve made the choices you have and put to rest any debate.
