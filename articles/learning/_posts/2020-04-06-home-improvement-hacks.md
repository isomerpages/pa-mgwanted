It's not difficult to learn how to perform simple fixes around your home. Taking matters into your own hands lets you save money, and leaves you with a deep sense of satisfaction and achievement, knowing that you’ve resolved a malfunction or made improvements with your own effort. All you need are some basic tools and the right know-how to get started. Here are some simple hacks to get you inspired!

### CREATE YOUR OWN LIGHTED SCREWDRIVER
A lighted screwdriver is a nifty tool to have around when working in dark spaces like the inside of a cabinet. Instead of buying fancy ones from the store, you can DIY your own by duct-taping a keychain-sized flashlight to the shaft of a screwdriver.

### USE OLD SNEAKERS AS LADDER BUMPERS
Why spend money on special rubber bumpers when you can improvise? You can protect your walls from dents and scratches by duct-tapping a pair of old sneakers to the top of your ladder.

### REMOVE WORN-OUT SCREWS WITH A BALLOON
Don't give up on removing a stripped or worn-out screw – the situation is still salvageable. Try putting a rubber balloon over the screw head. That way, it’ll give you extra grip and friction when you use a screwdriver to unscrew it.
