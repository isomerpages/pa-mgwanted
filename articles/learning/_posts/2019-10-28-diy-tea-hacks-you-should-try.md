Tea is one of Singapore's favourite beverages and we have been drinking it for generations! But having a cup is not the only thing you can do with these amazing leaves. Take a look at the natural DIY hacks below and try them out at home as a sustainable alternative to traditional methods!

### LEATHER POLISH
If your dark leather loafers or boots are looking a little worse for wear, don’t worry! Use a few damp teabags to remove all traces of dirt and grime. Just rub the teabag over the leather in a circular motion, swapping the teabags out often for the best clean. Buff your shoes with a soft, clean cloth after and they’ll look brand new.

### ODOUR CONTROL
Tea is a natural deodoriser! That means it is great for combating unwanted smells like stinky gym shoes and your cat's litter box. Put a few dry teabags in your shoes to keep them fresh – peppermint and lavender tea work great and leave your shoes smelling amazing! As for your kitty’s litter box, mix dry tea leaves into the litter to deodorise. The leaves have anti-bacterial properties, which will help to keep the box clean too!

### URBAN GARDENING
Used tea leaves are a great eco fertiliser. They contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which are ideal for plants. Simply sprinkle the leaves around the roots and scratch them into the soil to trap moisture and enrich your soil. Used teabags are also good for starting seedlings. Just plant 1 or 2 seeds in each bag and water generously. When the seedlings are big enough, plant them in soil – the tea leaves and paper will rot into the soil naturally, nourishing the young plants.
