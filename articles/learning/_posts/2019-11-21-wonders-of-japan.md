Renowned for its rich culture and captivating landscapes, Japan is a dream destination for many. Tokyo is often at the top of the list for tourists, drawing millions of visitors every year. But there is so much more to Japan than its capital city. Here’s a small taste of this incredible nation’s natural beauty.

### MOUNT FUJI
Although it has not erupted since 1707, Mount Fuji remains an active stratovolcano. A national icon, it is the highest point in Japan and the nation’s most popular tourist attraction. Clouds and poor visibility often obstruct a full view of the mountain, but on clear days, Fujiyama can be seen from Tokyo and Yokohama.

### TOTTORI SAND DUNES
An unexpected sight in Japan, Tottori’s vast desert-like vista stretches over 30 square kilometres. Ocean winds from the Sea of Japan have formed Tottori’s sand dunes over time, creating its undulating landscape.

### SAGANO BAMBOO FOREST
Just 30 minutes from central Kyoto, the towering Sagano Bamboo Forest is a tranquil retreat from the bustling city. The sound of wind passing through the dense thicket of trees creates a natural meditative atmosphere, combining aesthetic appeal with auditory calm.
