Online shopping can be intimidating when you don’t know where to start. But now that we’re in self-isolation, buying your groceries online is ideal to stay safe and away from groups of people. Take a look at some of the reasons why you should start shopping for groceries online and which websites you should visit to get started.

### GREATER VARIETY
With a multitude of online grocery stores to choose from, shopping online offers you a wider selection of goods to choose from. Not only can you search for your desired item with a click of a button, but you can also browse different categories to see what the store has to offer. 

Simply find the search bar and type in the product you’re looking for. Then, add it to your virtual basket!

### LESS HASSLE
Grocery shopping online means there’s no need to carry heavy bags home. Instead, your items get delivered right to your doorstep hassle-free!

Once you’ve added all the products you want to your basket, just click checkout and key in your payment method and address so it can be delivered.

### STAY SAFE
Making sure you and your loved ones are safe is vital during this period. That’s why it’s best to protect yourself from the risk of infection and avoid trips to the grocery store when possible.

Once you’ve checked out your items, all that’s left to do is wait for your groceries to arrive. Most websites will allow you to pick a delivery timeslot that is convenient for you and you will also receive a confirmation email that reiterates the expected date and time of your delivery.
