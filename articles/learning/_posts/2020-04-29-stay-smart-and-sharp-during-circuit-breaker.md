With circuit breaker measures now in place, practising social distancing is more important that ever. But staying home in solitude is easier said than done. Long periods of seclusion can lead to restlessness, loneliness and anxiety and maintaining motivation is vital to our mental health. Beat the boredom with these brain-boosting activities and make sure you stay sharp in self-isolation. 

### PICK UP A HOBBY
Whether it’s learning a new instrument or doing some DIY projects around the house, starting a new hobby can improve your productivity and mental health. Even if you’re not interested in learning something new, immersing yourself in an activity you already enjoy can help manage your stress levels while in isolation.

### UNWIND AND RELAX
Giving yourself a break is crucial to your ability to stay mindful and focused. Meditation and breathing exercises are a great way to do this and all you need is 5 to 10 minutes of your day to see results. Search online for guided meditations or calming ambient sounds to soothe your mind into a peaceful state and try to work your way up to longer sessions. You can even start with one-minute meditations in the morning for a calming start to your day.
